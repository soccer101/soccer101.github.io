            <center><h3>Prepare to Take Over: What to Look for</h3></center>
            <p>Hitler was evil to every eye of the lesser race. According to Hitler, there was a master and lesser race in Germany. The master race (AKA the Aryan Race) was every German with blue eyes and blonde hair. The lesser race was everyone who did not fit the description of a true German. When the Treaty of Versaille was signed, Hitler blamed the Jews. Germany was a perfect target for Hitler to take over because of political, social, and economic issues.
            <p>
                First, political issues. Political issues was a major thing before and when Hitler rose to power. Riots and rebellion would break out. Rebellion was breaking out because the leader was weak and had no control. Political instability was another reason Hitler took over. As Patricia Smith once said in her article Impact of Versailles, “By the early 1930s, Germany was in desperate shape. Its defeat in World War I and the harsh conditions imposed by the United States, Britain, and France...” People of Germany hated the Government before Hitler. People hated the government before Hitler, because they signed the Treaty of Versailles and the Germans thought that was not a good decision. In conclusion Germany had political issues.
        </p>
            <p>
                Next, social issues. Social issues then was very big. The people of Germany, and Hitler, were very humiliated that the Treaty of Versailles was signed. As Patricia Smith once said in her article Impact of Versailles,   “ ...1919 Treaty of Versailles—including debilitating reparation payments to the victors—had left Germany humiliated and impoverished...” People were fearing what was to come. Since people did not like that the Treaty of Versailles was signed they were scared of what the future was like for them and their social status. The people of Germany had trust issues with other countries and their government. People had trust issues with their government because they did something that the German people would have never done ; the government signed the Treaty of Versailles. To conclude the people of Germany had social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
                Furthermore, economic issues. Issues with the economy was quite big after WW1. The government created inflation. As Daniel Castillo said in his article German Economy in the 1920’s “Inflation reached the point where millions of marks were worthless.” Unemployment began after inflation started. After knowing that a whole wheelbarrow full of money would not buy a single loaf of bread, people had to quit jobs because the money was so worthless. Debt also became very large after WW1. Debt was big because Germany owed lots of money to the countries it damaged in the war and to America for the loans. In conclusion the economy issues made a huge impact on the people. 
        </p>
        <p>
                In conclusion Germany was a perfect target for Hitler to take over because of economy issues, political issues, and social issues. Germany was not in the best shape with Hitler in power. Germany was not in a very good state after the war, but once all of these problems started to get worse than before, things started to get out of hand.  As said before, Hitler blamed the Jews for the economy issues. Germany was very weak after the war and untill Hitler lost power.  As Daniel Castillo said in his article Germany Economy in the 1920’s,  “When the U.S. was hit by the great depression they immediately sought to get the loans, which they had made to German, paid back. This, in addition to all of Germany's other problems, practically caused the German economy to collapse.”
